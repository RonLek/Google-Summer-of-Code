I got a chance to work on the most downloaded App on Rocket.Chat - The Poll App!

From not having used Typescript before, to building an entire App completely in Typescript - 3 months of Google Summer of Code passed.

I intend to maintain this repository as a final report summary of my GSoC work and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract

The Rocket.Chat [Poll App](https://github.com/RocketChat/rocket.chat.app-poll) is the go-to app for teams and channel members of any Rocket.Chat room for a rich interactive poll. This project aims to hugely expand its scope making it a tool for enhancing participant's engagement with interactive quizzes / trivia / live-polls.

## üö¢ Deliverables

The following are the deliverables of this project:

- Improving upon the user-experience of existing response visualizations.
  - Highlight winner response [IMPROVEMENT].
  - Displaying dynamically updated total votes both during voting and after results. [IMPROVEMENT]
- Word cloud generation for both predefined and user-defined poll responses. [NEW]

- Ability to add user-options by channel members after poll creation. [NEW]
