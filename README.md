I got a chance to work on the most downloaded App on Rocket.Chat - The Poll App!

From not having used Typescript before, to building an entire App completely in Typescript - 3 months of Google Summer of Code passed.

I intend to maintain this repository as a final report summary of my GSoC work and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.

## Project Abstract üìΩÔ∏è
